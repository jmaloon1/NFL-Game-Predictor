# NFL-Game-Predictor

This program uses *fivethirtyeight.com* and *foxsports.com* and their NFL game predictions as well as betting odds from *vegasinsider.com* to track the quality of the predictions. The betting lines and results are written to a csv to keep track of them over a span of time. This program is written in Python and uses the Beautiful Soup library for web scraping.
